# Mushroom Classification Project

This project focuses on developing an ensemble model for classifying mushrooms using various machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The primary goal was to achieve high accuracy and a robust MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient) score on an imbalanced dataset.

## Overview

**Project:** Mushroom Classification using Python, TensorFlow, Keras, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM  
**Performance:** Achieved a **98.5% MCC score**  
**Dataset:** Based on the UCI Mushroom dataset, augmented by a deep learning-generated dataset  
**Tools & Libraries:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, scikit-learn

## Features

- **Ensemble Model:** Combined Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM to enhance model performance and robustness.
- **Imbalanced Dataset Handling:** Preprocessed and balanced the dataset, incorporating the original UCI Mushroom dataset for improved performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning & Stacking:** Leveraged hyperparameter optimization and stacking techniques for better accuracy.
- **Cross-Validation:** Used cross-validation to ensure model generalization and stability.

## Results

- **Accuracy:** 98.5% MCC score, showing the ensemble modelâ€™s ability to handle class imbalance effectively.
